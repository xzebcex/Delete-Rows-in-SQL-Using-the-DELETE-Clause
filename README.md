# **Delete Rows in SQL Using the DELETE Clause**
This SQL query employs the DELETE statement to delete a record from the "students" table with the value 72001 in the "student id" column.
The WHERE clause is used to indicate the criterion for deleting entries. It is set to "student id = 72001" in this example, which implies that just the record with the student id 72001 would be removed.
This method cannot be reversed, and the record will be permanently removed from the table. If you need to alter specific values within a record, use the UPDATE statement instead.
Before running this query, please double-check the prerequisites and ensure you have the necessary permissions
